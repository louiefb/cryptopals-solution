# cryptopals-solution
Learning crypto by attempting to solve the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges.

RULES
=====
In order to develop a better understanding of the concepts involved, all the tools and method must be created from scratch. This means we can't cut corners by employing pre-made converters. If we have to XOR, an XOR function is created. Same goes for all the conversion tools (HEX to binary, base64 to ASCII, etc.).

PROGRESS
========
Currently at Challenge 5 Set 1.
Slow but steady of course.
